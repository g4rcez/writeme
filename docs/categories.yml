    [Writeme](https://github.com/g4rcez/writeme) is under development, so you can't install. But you can use online in [online demo](https://writeme.vercel.app).


    # Clone


    ```shell

    git clone https://github.com/g4rcez/writeme

    ```


    # Install


    First, we need to install dependencies

    ```shell

    # I prefer to use pnpm, but you can use yarn or npm

    pnpm install

    # or with yarn

    yarn install

    # or with npm

    npm install

    ```


    # Enjoy


    After install, just run the project

    ```shell

    npm run dev

    ```
