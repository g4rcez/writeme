# MDX

- Javascript expressions: `{6 * Math.PI}` === {6 * Math.PI}
- [Comments](https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-build.html#how-can-i-write-comments-in-jsx) like in a React app

## Tabs

Support tabs with [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) or using comment with `{/* |tabs */}` to open and `{/* /tabs */}` to close. In comment mode, you
can pass the default tab after `|tabs`, just like this `{/* |tabs your-id */}`

{/* |tabs second */}

## First

This is first tab content

## Second

This is second tab content

{/* /tabs */}

## How Tab titles work?

Titles inside tabs comments aren't displayed in `<TableOfContent />` component. You can see the title of this section, because the title is out of `<Tabs/>` comments.

## Playground

Use [Sandpack](https://github.com/codesandbox/sandpack/ "Sandpack github page") playground to run Javascript/Typescrit code using your favorite [template](https://sandpack.codesandbox.io/docs/getting-started/custom-content#templates)

<Playground test="AA" />

# Http Request

Focus in web API docs, this component receive a `curl` or `http` command and transform in amazing HTTP Request visualizer. Create a code mark with bash language and pass `type=request` or just paste your code with `curl` or `http` at the beginning of the command.

````bash
```bash type=request
curl -X POST "{{host}}/api/test" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"email":"write@me.com"}'
```
````

Request to another domain

```bash type=request
curl -X GET "https://api.postmon.com.br/v1/cep/55641715" -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```
