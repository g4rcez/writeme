[Writeme](https://github.com/g4rcez/writeme) is under development, so you can't install. But you can use online in [online demo](https://writeme.vercel.app).

# Clone

```shell
git clone https://github.com/g4rcez/writeme
```

# Install

First, we need to install dependencies
```shell
# I prefer to use pnpm, but you can use yarn or npm
pnpm install
# or with yarn
yarn install
# or with npm
npm install
```

# Enjoy

After install, just run the project
```shell
npm run dev
```
