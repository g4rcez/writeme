There's no place like :house:

# Tabs

Support tabs with MDX or using comment with `<!-- |tabs -->` to open and `<!-- /tabs -->` to close. In comment mode, you can pass the default tab after `|tabs`

<!-- |tabs second -->

## First

This is first tab content

## Second

This is second tab content

<!-- /tabs -->

## Http Request

Focus in web API docs, this component receive a `curl` command and transform in amazing http request visualizer. Create a code mark with bash language and pass `type=request`

````bash
\```bash type=request
curl -X POST "http://localhost:3000/api/test" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"email":"write@me.com"}'
\```
````

\*\*In this example we use the `\` to avoid example parse.

```bash type=request
curl -X POST "http://localhost:3000/api/test" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"email":"write@me.com"}'
```

~~This component is connected to `HttpResponse` using the `HttpContext` and share the state about request/response to create a better experience for readers. This integration may have bugs `Error: Parse Error: Content-Length can't be present with Transfer-Encoding`. If you know how to solve this problem, please open a [Pull Request](https://github.com/g4rcez/writeme/pulls)~~
HttpRequest and HttpResponse now is a single component
