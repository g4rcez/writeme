[Writeme](https://github.com/g4rcez/writeme) is under development, so you can't install it. But you can use it online in [online demo](https://writeme.vercel.app).

# Clone

```shell
git clone https://github.com/g4rcez/writeme
```

# Install

First, we need to install dependencies

```shell
# I prefer to use pnpm, but you can use yarn or npm
pnpm install
# or with yarn
yarn install
# or with npm
npm install
```

# Enjoy

After install, just run the project

```shell
npm run dev
```

# Deploy

This is a web app created using [Next.JS](https://nextjs.org/), so you can deploy easily at [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). You can just type

```shell
npm run build
```
