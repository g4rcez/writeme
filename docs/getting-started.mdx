# Start devolopment
First of all, you need to start the writeme web server.

```bash
npm run dev
```

# Writeme model

In writeme we have two main models, the **Document** and the **Category**. Both are very important to build, filter documents by category, aggregate all documents in a single category section...

## Category

You can go to `http://localhost:3000/dashboard/categories` and create your first category

## Document
You can go to `http://localhost:3000/dashboard/documents/new` and create your first document. *This party doesn't okay yet. I need to create a select for category*
